My personal website built with its own static website generator.

I wrote my own static website generator for building this website without using
front-end frameworks, such as React, Angular or VueJS, for example.

## Build

```
yarn build
```

This command above will generate a `public` directory containing all the statically generated files. After that, CI will do the rest of the work
by uploading artifacts to GitHub Pages.
