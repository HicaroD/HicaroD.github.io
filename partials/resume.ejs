    </p>
    <p>
      I&#39;m a ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· brazilian software engineer with more than 3 years of
      experience and Computer Science student at Universidade Federal de Alagoas
      (UFAL).
    </p>
    <p>
      More especifically, I am a mobile and backend developer. Previously, I've
      worked at Otimize, a Brazilian startup that is pioneering the use
      of technology to evaluate human movement kinematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also love compilers. My main personal project is a compiler for my own
      programming language called <i>idk</i>. This compiler is being written in
      the
      <a class="link" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank"
        >Rust programming language</a
      >
      with hand-written lexical, syntactic, and semantic algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my spare time, I have made sporadic contributions to open-source
      developer tools, such as
      <a

        Lua)</a
      >
      and
