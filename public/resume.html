  <p id="about-me" class="section"><a href="#about-me">#</a> About me</p>
  <p>
  I&#39;m a ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· brazilian software engineer with more than 3 years of
  experience and Computer Science student at Universidade Federal de Alagoas
  (UFAL).
  </p>

  <p>
  More especifically, I am a mobile and backend developer. I am
  currently working at Otimize, a Brazilian startup that is pioneering the use
  of technology to evaluate human movement kinematics.
  </p>

  <p>
  I also love
  compilers. My main personal project is a compiler for my own programming
  language called &quot;idk&quot;. This compiler is being written in Rust with
  hand-written lexical, syntactic, and semantic algorithms. Currently, I&#39;m
  planning to use LLVM to build the backend in order to produce fast and
  optimized code for several platforms. About the language&#39;s syntax, I got
  inspiration from other languages, such as Python, Rust, Go, and Odin. Soon it
  will be open-source so I can hopefully receive help from more experienced
  compiler developers on the Internet.
  </p>

  <p>
  During my spare time, I have made sporadic contributions to open-source
  developer tools, such as telescope.nvim (fuzzy finder for the Neovim text
  editor written in Lua) and quick-lint-js (a JavaScript linter written in
  C++).
  </p>

  <p id="skills" class="section"><a href="#skills">#</a> Skills</p>

  <ul>
    <li>

    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Skills in several programming languages, including Python, Typescript
    (NodeJS), Java, Dart, Rust and Go. Thanks to my problem-solving skills, I

    and frameworks according to the task's requirements.
    </li> 
    <br>
    <li>
    Fluent in conversational English and with advanced writing skills. I'm EC2
    Proficient in the EF Standard English Test.
